I am writing to apply for the position  offered by your institute as Data Analyst. My name
is Matteo Lorenzini. I'm an archaeologist with strong background and competences in digital humanities
 and digital archaeology. Thanks to my ITs skills I had the opportunity to work
in many European projects. In this context I think one of the most important experience was represented by my partecipation in European Network
of Excellence EPOCH. Thanks to  EPOCH project I have been involved in different research groups where
I gained the opportunity to deepen my knowledge in digital management of cultural heritage and semantics,
mainly concerning the management and semantic definition of archaeological data through CIDOC-CRM ontology. 
During the project I have applied CIDOC-CRM to the conceptual and semantic mapping of ICCD data schema and different kind of datasets referred to archaeological domain. 
Another important milestone is represented by my work at Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities in Cultura Italia project, the italian digital library, as
Project Manager and IT consultant. I have focused my activities in data and metadata mapping (using XML
and XSLT technology) and  representation  using CIDOC-CRM ontology. During my experience at Cultura Italia I have worked also As Project Manager I was involved in the engineering of the digital library
coordinating the activities both related to the development of triple store and metadata indexing
engine (using Apache Solr) both related to the visualization and fruition of metadata content using
facet browsing system and to the development of SPARQL endpoint (www.dati.culturaitalia.it). During this job experience I have acquired a deep knowledge on
metadata definitions using CIDOC-CRM and Europeana Data Model, metadata exsposition as LOD and skossification
process. During my period at Cultura Italia I had also the opportunity both to work with Europeana
team concerning data mapping from PICO application profile to EDM both to take part in
some workshop related to engagement of different content provider in Europeana. During the same period I've worked also as researcher at Universit\'a   Politecnica delle
Marche in SemLib -Semantic Tool for Digital Libraries- project for that concerning the semantical
management of annotation of digital contents and as Data Scientist for an IT company focusing my
activities on to data mapping from RDBMS system to CIDOC-CRM conceptual schema.

However I think that the most important experience for my education in digital humanitites and digital archaeology is represented by my collaboration with Center for Textual and Spatial Analysis at  Stanford University (CA, USA). In 2012 I
won a fellowship application from the University of Sassari to making a postgraduate school of
specialization in Digital Humanities. Here I have carried a special study plan focused on digital
archeology in particular on the study and development of ontological model for the representation
and visualization of descriptive metadata from digital archives and repositories. Thanks to my
fellowship I went to Stanford University in 2013 as visiting researcher at the Department of History,
CESTA lab -Center for Textual and Spatial Analysis- with a project focused on the semantical representation and visualization of geographical archaeological feature. Here I have improved my
knowledge on the development of big data management-analysis and data
visualization-representation (mainly using NodeJS, D3JS and SCALA language program)
participating in many workshops organized by the department.

Till December 2014  I've worked as R\&D operations officer for
an Italian IT company (fixed term contract). Here I have focused my activities in two
european projects: SDI4APPS and Linda. The first one seeks to build a cloud-based framework
with open API for data integration focusing on the development of six pilot applications. The
project draws along the lines of INSPIRE, Copernicus and GEOSS and aspires to build a WIN-WIN
strategy for building a successful business for hundreds of SMEs on the basis of European spatial
data infrastructures. The second one represent an ecosystem for Linked Data publication and
consumption apps (visualization,exploration, data mining), which can be bound together in a
dynamic manner, leading to new, unpredicted insights. For both of projects I'm involved in writing
project deliverable.

Thanks to my all past  experience I have matured a well defined aptitude for teamwork.  
 I consider this job position as an ideal place to work where I can make
in practice my special background focused on digital humanities and digital archaeologyin a really enthusiastic and collaborative
team where I can develop and share a specific expertise in an international context.

 I hope you will consider my application congruous to yours expectations.
